## Abstract
The project delves into the development of a 'bio-mimetic mechatronic hands' aiming to overcome the limitations of current bionic hand technologies. Traditional prosthetic hand often  exhibits restricted movement and functionality, hindering users to experience natural movement and perform intricate tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an approach utilizing open source hand tracking to mimic human hand movements with 27 degrees of freedom using similar to a natural human hand. Our focus lies on creating a bionic hand such that it can emulate real human-like movement, and fluidity
